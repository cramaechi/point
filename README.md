# Point
A program that uses a class called point to store and manipulate points in the plane.

## Setup
1. Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), if you don't already have it.

2. Open terminal and run the git clone command:

   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/cramaechi/point.git
   ```
    or [download as ZIP](https://github.com/cramaechi/point/archive/master.zip).

3. Go to the project folder:

   ```
   $ cd point
   ```

4. Compile:

   ```
   $ make
   ```
   
## Usage
Run:

```
$ ./point
```

Sample Output:
```
